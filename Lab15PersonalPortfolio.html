        <p id="byitself">  My life can seem pretty boring but you are wrong. I have a super duper exciting life. I have 4 cats and I'm married. 
           It may seem like a mundane but you are wrong. I like to cook and go camping. I love video game and building custom PC's. 
           If you think that may be boring you are still wrong. Most of my days consist of going to school, studying, eating, sleeping 
           and occasionally going out with my wife and friends.  If that still seems boring to you, you are still wrong. 
           I also like to mow my lawn.  Next I will tell you a little bit about myself in my development page and portfolio page listed at 
           the bottom.
