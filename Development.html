        <h1>My development Career</h1>
        <p id="DevId">My career in development has just begun and in face has not even started yet. I am currently enrolled at Grand Circus learning 
        c#.Net. I have a pretty great teacher Anna and like wise a pretty great TA Steven.  It has honestly been a pretty big struggle for
        me personally but no great things come without a cost.  Right now that cost is free time and mental clarity. By saying I have no free
        time is just saying that I am doing something that will benefit me and my family in the future. I have chosen what I think will be 
        a truely great career and if it means I have to sacrifice some free time and mental clarity, so be it. On the mental clarity note. 
        I am just saying that the people at Grand Circus are giving me a chance to learn a vast amount of information in a short amount of 
        time so that I can fast track my career in IT and software development.
        Just if anyone is interested in checking out some of the projects I have been working on I have left a link to my github below.
